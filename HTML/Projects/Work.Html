                <dt>Sales Manager:</dt>
                <dd>I worked as a Sales Manager for 3 months at Business Matters International. I learnt from this experience many new skills as team work,problems solving and communication. I also find this new adventure as a way to figure out what I really want from life and what should my next step be in order to get to a better version of myself. </dd>
